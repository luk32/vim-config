## luk32's vim config files.

My `.vim` directory with plugins I use and their configuration. It uses `pathogene` for plugins and stores `rc` files locally in the project.

## Installation.

The most basic installation is to make symlinks from home directory to the project files in `.vim`:

```
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vim.rc
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvim.rc
```

One could also source them in other way, but be ware of any conflicts.
